This repository contains the recipe book written in polish langiage, with recipes that I use regularly. To make my life easier, I wanted to collect them in one place and standardize them. Book was generated using R Markdown and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) R package. Book is automatically deployed to netlify on every commit, [here is a link to it](https://jjrecipes.netlify.app).
